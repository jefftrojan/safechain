# SAFE-chain: Empowering Healthcare with Blockchain

## Overview

SAFE-chain is a blockchain application built on the Internet Computer (ICP) platform. Our mission is to transform the healthcare system by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. We aim to empower patients by providing them with full ownership and control over their health data.

## How It Works

SAFE-chain operates on the ICP blockchain, utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage to secure and manage health data. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Patient Ownership:** Patients have full control over their health data, granting and revoking access as needed.

2. **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts govern the access and sharing of health data, ensuring transparency and accountability.

3. **Decentralized Storage:** Utilize the decentralized storage capabilities of ICP for secure and tamper-resistant health data storage.
